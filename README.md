# SCC

### SCC (Simple C Compiler) is a C compiler, that is focused on having simple code.

## Introduction
SCC is a compiler that I'm writing in my free time, mainly for the purpose of learning/practice. It is currently in a non-functional state. 

## Compiling
### Required Programs
- CMake (version >= 3.12)
- make
- g++

Running the `build.sh` file will compile the the program into the executable `scc`
